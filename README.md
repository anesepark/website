Experimental personal website created during the RedVentures software engineering internship in 2021. First used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, then transitioned into using React and SCSS to allow for reusability.

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run:
If there is a problem with SASS compiling, download node-sass:
#### `npm install node-sass`

In the project directory, you can run:
#### `npm start`

This runs the website in developmental mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
